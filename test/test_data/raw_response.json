                            "bodyTextSummary": "A herd of feral pigs believed to have been illegally released in the Cairngorms have been successfully corralled by estate workers who are now attempting to trap them. The animals were first spotted near the Uath Lochans area, close to the village of Inch and only 5 miles from where four lynx were illegally released last month. The sighting of the pigs has prompted further concerns about rogue activists intent on rewilding the Highlands by stealth, with local farmers suggesting the area was becoming “a dumping ground”. As efforts continued during the day to trap the animals, which appeared to be fairly tame, the Cairngorms national park authority said it condemned any illegal release of animals “in the strongest possible terms”. The group of nine was corralled into a fenced-off 20-hectare (50-acre) field in the late afternoon after being lured by a trail of maize. A small team of estate and Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) workers will now try to trap the animals. Four Eurasian lynx were humanely captured by experts from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) in early January after they were abandoned near Kingussie, where temperatures plunged as low at -14C, but one subsequently died. The RZSS said the lynx would have been under great stress after being abandoned in the “extremely harsh” environment. Wild boar were native to Scotland, but hunted to extinction about 700 years ago. Over the past 10 years, populations of free-roaming feral pigs numbering in the low thousands have become established in Dumfries and Galloway and the Highlands. These include animals that have escaped from farms, as well as those illegally released into the wild, and hybrids of wild boar and domestic pigs. While not usually aggressive towards humans, a feral pig can weigh up to 100kg and may pose a risk to livestock, wildlife and farmland. Robert MacDonald, a beef and sheep farmer on the edge of Grantown-on-Spey and chair of the Cairngorms Crofters and Farmers Community, credited FLS for acting quickly but said that the latest illegal release raised serious concerns about “this new phenomenon” of guerilla rewilding and potential copycat incidents. “I am concerned that the Cairngorms is now seen as a dumping ground from any wild animal. These people are on a mission, but are acting with no consultation with the local people who have to live and work in that landscape and ignorance of the animals themselves.” Local farmers were particularly concerned about the potential for disease spread, given the unknown provenance of the animals, said MacDonald. He also said that feral pigs regularly damage fences, allowing sheep and cattle to escape, while their rooting behaviour destroys pasture, hay fields, and crops such as barley and oats, with newly planted fields being especially vulnerable. Scottish Land and Estates (SLE), which supports rural businesses, condemned the “reckless” release, and encouraged anyone with information to contact the police as it coordinated the trapping efforts. Tom Cameron, Forestry and Land Scotland’s north region area wildlife manager, said the corral trapping system was “for their own welfare and because we don’t know their origin or whether there is the potential for them to spread any disease across domesticated livestock in the area”. Cameron asked local people to stay away from the area in the meantime. “As we work to do this, we are asking anyone not involved with the operation to stay away from the area so trained staff can do their job and the animals are not unduly stressed or startled.” The three surviving lynx remain in quarantine in Edinburgh zoo.

Possibly not as big as Take That singer Gary Barlow’s son, but fairly massive nonetheless. Contested by Corinthians and Palmeiras, rival sides in the Brazilian city of São Paulo, the most recent one was a league match played on Monday night and won 2-0 by Corinthians, whose striker Yuri Alberto scored one of their goals. However, the 23-year-old’s smart finish at the end of a lightning fast second-half counterattack wasn’t his only strike of note in the game. While the match was still scoreless with a little over 30 minutes played at Corinthians’ NeoQuimica Arena, Palmeiras were awarded a corner but before they could take it, Alberto trotted towards the sideline to boot a beanbag or pillow thrown from the crowd off the pitch.

Having spent decades being disparaged by Corinthians fans as “pigs”, in 1986, Palmeiras decided to embrace the insult by chanting it about themselves with increasing frequency until one of their players, Jorginho Putinatti, posed on the cover of Placar magazine holding a cute little piglet in his arms.

They are invading the beach resorts of southern Spain with increasing frequency, even roaming the streets of Málaga and other cities. It’s not just Spain either – they’ve been spotted digging up gardens and frolicking on beaches in Brittany this autumn too.</p> \n<p><strong>Hang on, an image is coming back to me. An image of … a naked German man? </strong>Yes, you’re recalling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/07/german-nudist-chases-wild-boar-that-stole-laptop-berlin-teufelssee\">the nude bather in Berlin who gave chase</a> when a family of boars nicked his laptop back in 2020. They are becoming more common there, too, and in many European cities.</p> \n<p><strong>Why? I bet it’s our fault. </strong>Yes, of course. The climate crisis has led to drought and forest fires in their natural mountain habitats, meaning the boars are short of water and it’s harder for them to find food. Cities are full of tasty food waste for them to plunder, and water sources. But it’s also about numbers.</p> \n<p><strong>Are there more boars around generally then? </strong>Yes – according to boar expert Dr Giovanna Massei of the University of York, “the population of wild boar is growing incredibly quickly worldwide. This is largely due to the declining numbers of hunters.”</p> \n<p><strong>I’m struggling to see this as a problem: for once an animal is thriving! Wild boar are cute, too. </strong>Well, if 70kg of hairy muscle is your type, I suppose so, but unfortunately, they are causing havoc. Rifling through tourist’s picnics is just the tip of the iceberg: boars are causing road accidents and attacking dogs. They can also transmit diseases such as African swine fever and, Massei says, “tuberculosis toxoplasmosis that can be transmitted to humans”.</p> \n<p><strong>So what can be done about them? </strong>Well, some parts of the Costa del Sol have implemented a cull. In 2022, the municipality of Mijas hired archers to shoot and kill them, and Marbella and Málaga councils have also allowed them to be hunted by archers.</p> \n<p><strong>That seems awfully brutal. </strong>Yes, vets and animal rights groups have protested and Málaga has suspended the programme and is trying a different approach: shooting boar with tranquilliser darts, then getting them humanely euthanised.</p> \n<p><strong>That’s still a bit of a downer. Are there other ways to keep the boar at bay? </strong>Some places have installed drinking troughs to allow the boar to drink without heading to beach bars for a cheeky <em>cerveza</em>. There’s also a pilot programme in Italy giving them oral contraceptives.</p> \n<p><strong>Pigs on the pill! </strong>Yes, it’s probably better than stags on the pull.</p> \n<p><strong>Do say:</strong> “This beach is overrun with hairy grunting beasts trashing everything.”</p> \n<p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “And the boars are a problem, too.”</p> \n<p>• This article was amended on 28 October 2024 because an earlier version described Mijas as a city, when it is a municipality.</p>"

                            "bodyTextSummary": "Police accused Robert and Anne Geeves of murdering teenager Amber Haigh to take her baby and then disposing of her body by feeding it to pigs, the New South Wales supreme court has heard. The seventh week of the Geeves murder trial heard extraordinary evidence about the arrest of Robert and Anne Geeves in May of 2022, two decades after Haigh disappeared without a trace. Haigh, who had an intellectual disability, was 19 when she vanished from the NSW Riverina in June 2002, leaving behind her five-month-old son. The father of Haigh’s child, 64-year-old Robert Geeves, and his wife, Anne Geeves, also 64, are on trial for her alleged murder. Both have pleaded not guilty.\nPolice arrested the Geeveses on 4 May 2022. About 10.30am, in the cells at Young police station, Anne Geeves declined to be interviewed by police. But the court heard she had a conversation with Det Sen Const Amanda Cary, which Cary recorded in her police notebook. In court on Thursday, crown prosecutor Paul Kerr questioned Cary on that 2022 conversation, where the detective had put the allegation to Anne Geeves that she had “on or about 5 June 2002” murdered Haigh. Anne Geeves denied the allegation. In court, Kerr asked Cary: “Did you put the allegation that she had disposed of Amber Haigh’s body?” “Yes,” Cary replied. “Did she deny that?” “Yes.” “Did you say to her ‘I believe you to be equally involved in her murder’?” “Yes.” “When you say equally, with who?” Cary responded: “With Robert Geeves.” “Did you put to her the allegation that it was police belief that Amber Haigh was murdered because the Geeves wanted custody of [her] baby?” Kerr continued. “Yes,” Cary replied. “Did she deny that?” Kerr asked. “Yes.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The court also heard evidence that, on the evening of 2 July 2002, Robert Geeves called eight neighbouring rural properties in the space of 90 minutes seeking permission to access people’s land – enquiring after farm equipment or if he could collect fire wood. Recalling the alleged conversation in the Young police station cell, the court heard evidence that Cary said to Anne Geeves: “I believe you did go on that land driving the Suzuki and I believe you did dispose of Amber’s body. I believe you helped Robert each time and I believe you to be equally involved.” Anne Geeves replied: “No.” Cary said: “I don’t believe you actually killed Amber, but I believe you were present, and you knew it was going to happen and you helped dispose of her body to pigs. What can you tell me about that?” Anne Geeves replied: “No. Pigs? No.” The court also heard evidence of police investigations into a chainsaw bought by the Geeveses – paid for by cheque, the butt of which was found by investigators – on 13 June 2002. On Thursday, the court heard evidence about Robert and Anne Geeves’s arrest on 4 May 2022, at their property on the outskirts of Harden. Driving the Geeveses to Young police station, Cary said she asked Anne Geeves if she wanted to know “what is new” in the 20-year-old case. Cary told Anne Geeves a new witness, who had not previously spoken to police, had come forward to say that he had seen Anne and Robert Geeves, along with Haigh and her baby, on the afternoon of 5 June 2002 at his property in Boorowa. The Geeveses had said they were travelling with Haigh and her child to Sydney. But the witness told police he saw Anne, Robert and the baby at a nearby petrol station an hour later, but that Haigh was not present. Anne Geeves responded to Cary that she didn’t know anybody in Boorowa. James Arber, from Boorowa, gave evidence earlier in this trial that he’d seen the Geeveses and Haigh that afternoon.

The intercepts also record the couple talking playfully to Haigh’s five-month-old son, who was in their custody at the time. Haigh’s unresolved disappearance has been an enduring mystery in the Riverina. The court has heard she “adored” her son and “never let out of her sight”. Haigh’s body has never been found, but a coroner has ruled she died from “homicide or misadventure”. The prosecution has alleged in court that Haigh was used by Robert and Anne Geeves as a “surrogate mother” because they wanted another baby. Amber Haigh ‘removed from the equation’, court told The prosecution alleged that once Haigh’s baby was born, they sought to have her “removed from the equation” by killing her. The court has previously heard the Geeveses had had one child together – a son the same age as Haigh, who had previously dated her – but the couple wanted more children, having subsequently endured three miscarriages and a stillbirth. “The crown case theory is that it was always the intention of the Geeveses to assume the custody and care of [the child] from Amber, but they knew that to do that, Amber had to be removed from the equation … so – the crown asserts – they killed her.” Lawyers for Robert and Anne Geeves have argued the case against the couple is deeply flawed.\nMichael King, acting for Anne Geeves, said his client did not kill Haigh, and had “no motive to kill Amber, or even wish her dead”. King said others in the community – who disapproved of the Geeves’ relationship with Haigh – were “all too quick to point the finger” at the couple when she disappeared. “Everything they did was viewed through a haze of mistrust and suspicion,” he told the court.

I believe you helped Robert each time and I believe you to be equally involved.”</p> \n<p>Anne Geeves replied: “No.”</p> \n<p>Cary said: “I don’t believe you actually killed Amber, but I believe you were present, and you knew it was going to happen and you helped dispose of her body to pigs. What can you tell me about that?”</p> \n<p>Anne Geeves replied: “No. Pigs? No.”</p> \n<p>The court also heard evidence of police investigations into a chainsaw bought by the Geeveses – paid for by cheque, the butt of which was found by investigators – on 13 June 2002.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, the court heard evidence about Robert and Anne Geeves’s arrest on 4 May 2022, at their property on the outskirts of Harden.</p> \n<p>Driving the Geeveses to Young police station, Cary said she asked Anne Geeves if she wanted to know “what is new” in the 20-year-old case.</p> \n<p>Cary told Anne Geeves a new witness, who had not previously spoken to police, had come forward to say that he had seen Anne and Robert Geeves, along with Haigh and her baby, on the afternoon of 5 June 2002 at his property in Boorowa. The Geeveses had said they were travelling with Haigh and her child to Sydney.</p> \n<p>But the witness told police he saw Anne, Robert and the baby at a nearby petrol station an hour later, but that Haigh was not present.</p> \n<p>Anne Geeves responded to Cary that she didn’t know anybody in Boorowa.</p> \n<p>James Arber, from Boorowa, gave evidence earlier in this trial that he’d seen the Geeveses and Haigh that afternoon. But under cross-examination he conceded he may have estimated the date he saw her after watching a news item on her disappearance.</p>"

                            "bodyTextSummary": "Britain has banned imports of German pork, lamb, beef and dairy products to prevent foot-and-mouth disease spreading to the UK after a case of the disease was confirmed last Friday on the outskirts of Berlin. As well as prohibiting imports of ham, bacon, salami and cheese, the measure bans the import of live cattle, sheep and pigs, along with other animals which are susceptible to foot-and-mouth. No health certificates will be issued by Britain for fresh meat from Germany. “Ham, gammon and bacon as well as products like salami from Germany will not be allowed into the UK,” said Mandy Nevel, head of animal health and welfare at the UK’s Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB). “We are expecting some disruption to supply,” Nevel added. Germany is the third-largest exporter of pork to the UK, and has an 18% market share, while it is also the second-largest exporter to the UK of dairy products including cheese, yoghurt and buttermilk. The government said there were currently no cases of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the measures would help to prevent it spreading to Britain, protecting farmers and their livelihoods. Foot-and-mouth disease does not pose any risk to human or food safety, but is a highly contagious viral disease which affects cattle, sheep, pigs and other animals with cloven hooves. A particularly severe outbreak of foot-and-mouth in Britain in 2001 saw 2,000 cases of the disease officially recorded and led to the slaughter of more than 6 million sheep, cattle and pigs, wrecking the finances of many farmers. A case of foot-and-mouth disease in Germany was confirmed in a herd of water buffalo in Brandenburg, outside of Berlin, on 10 January, according to the country’s food and agriculture ministry. It added that exclusion zones had been established in the affected area, banning the transport of animals or animal products. Hundreds of animals in Berlin are currently being tested for the disease, according to German media reports. The outbreak means that Germany can not be classed as free of foot-and-mouth disease and the UK’s import ban is likely to be the first of several trade restrictions. It is the first case of the disease in the EU for several years. The UK’s chief veterinary officer is calling on farmers and livestock keepers to remain vigilant for any signs of the disease in their animals and to maintain good biosecurity. Signs of the disease vary by animal, but cattle suffer from sores and blisters on their feet, mouth and tongue, as well as lameness and problems feeding.\nDr Christine Middlemiss, the UK’s chief vet, said there were “robust contingency plans in place to manage the risk of this disease to protect farmers and Britain’s food security”. The farming minister, Daniel Zeichner, said the government would “not hesitate to add additional countries” to the list of banned imports, should the foot and mouth outbreak spread beyond Germany.",
